# LLM-Powered Python Game Generator

This project explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically generate Python-based games. It aims to showcase how LLMs can be leveraged to design, prototype, and build playable 2D games with minimal human intervention.

## 🔍 Project Overview

- 🛠️ **LLM Integration**: Uses state-of-the-art LLMs to produce clean and functional Python game scripts.
- 🎮 **Game Variety**: Focus on classic 2D games — from arcade clones to simple puzzles.
- 🧪 **Experimentation**: A sandbox for testing code generation, reasoning capabilities, and real-time feedback loops with AI.
