# 🎮 LLM Game Development Workshop

**Purpose**: 20-30 minute workshop demonstrating AI-assisted game development using LLM agents (GitHub Copilot CLI)  
**Goal**: Build a complete Snake game from scratch using natural language prompts  
**Target Audience**: Students interested in AI-assisted programming  

## 📁 Workshop Materials

### Essential Files:
- **`docs/workshop_prompts_optimized.md`** - Complete prompt sequence for live demo
- **`docs/demo_script.md`** - Step-by-step demo guide with timing and talking points
- **`backup_snake_game.py`** - Emergency backup game (fully functional)
- **`requirements.txt`** - Python dependencies

### Legacy/Reference Files:
- `docs/demo_prompts.md` - Original demo prompts (more complex)
- `docs/prompts_step-by-step.md` - Detailed step-by-step version
- `docs/quick_demo_script.md` - Quick reference script

## 🚀 Quick Start for Demo

### Pre-Demo Setup:
```bash
# Create fresh demo directory
mkdir snake-demo && cd snake-demo

# Ensure dependencies are available
pip install pygame>=2.5.0

# Have GitHub Copilot CLI ready
# Open VS Code for coding
# Enable screen sharing
```

### Demo Flow:
1. **Phase 1** (5 min): Use Prompt 1 from `workshop_prompts_optimized.md`
2. **Phase 2** (7 min): Debug and fix with Prompts 2-3
3. **Phase 3** (10 min): Visual enhancement with Prompts 4-5
4. **Phase 4** (3 min): Final demo and course promotion

### Emergency Backup:
If prompts fail, use `backup_snake_game.py` immediately:
```bash
cp backup_snake_game.py snake_game.py
python snake_game.py
```

## 🎯 Workshop Objectives

### Technical Demonstration:
- AI understands natural language requirements
- AI generates complete, working code
- AI debugs and fixes problems automatically
- AI enhances functionality and appearance

### Student Engagement:
- Show power of AI-assisted development
- Demonstrate rapid prototyping capabilities
- Generate interest in learning prompt engineering
- Promote course registration

## 📊 Success Metrics

### Minimum Viable Demo:
- ✅ Working Snake game generated by AI
- ✅ Students see AI respond to natural language
- ✅ At least one visual enhancement applied
- ✅ Game runs smoothly during final demo

### Ideal Outcomes:
- ✅ All prompts work as expected
- ✅ Multiple visual enhancements (colorful food, 3D effects)
- ✅ Students are visibly impressed
- ✅ Students ask follow-up questions
- ✅ Course interest generated

## ⚠️ Risk Management

### Common Issues & Solutions:
- **Prompt generates broken code**: Use backup file, focus on enhancements
- **WASD controls don't work**: Have fix prompt ready in demo script
- **Visual effects fail**: Show basic version, explain what AI can do
- **Time running out**: Skip optional prompts, use backup features

### Backup Plans:
1. **Plan A**: All prompts work perfectly (ideal scenario)
2. **Plan B**: Use backup for basic game, demo enhancements live
3. **Plan C**: Show pre-built game, explain AI development process
