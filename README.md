# 🐍 AI-Powered Snake Game Demo

This project demonstrates how **AI-assisted coding** can accelerate software development using **Copilot CLI**, **VS Code**, and **Gradio**.  
We start from a natural language **prompt**, generate working Python code with **Copilot**, and create a playable, web-based **Snake Game** — all in under 15 minutes.

---

## 🎯 Objective
Show students how **Prompt Engineering + Vibe Coding + Visualization** can turn an idea into a real, interactive application.  
This demo also introduces the workflow used in the upcoming course:  
**CISC 3XX — Applied Generative AI and LLM Applications**

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Python 3.9+**
- **Gradio** (for browser-based UI)
- **VS Code + Copilot CLI (Pro EDU)**  
- **GitHub** (version control & sharing)
