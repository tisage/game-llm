# 🐍 Snake Game - 20-Minute AI Demo Prompts

**Demo Purpose**: Student engagement & course promotion  
**Time Limit**: 20-30 minutes  
**Focus**: Show AI coding power + generate interest in new course  
**Target Audience**: Students (interest-driven)

## Demo Script (4 Phases, 6 Prompts)

### Phase 1: Concept to Code (5 minutes)
**Goal**: Show how AI understands and plans

### Prompt 1: Game Concept
```
I want to build a Snake game using Python and Pygame with WASD controls, real-time movement, collision detection, and score tracking. 

Create a complete working Snake game with:
- 20x15 grid
- WASD keyboard controls
- Food consumption and growth
- Collision detection with walls and self
- Score display
- Clean, modular code structure

Please implement the full game with all necessary files and make sure it runs immediately.
```

---

### Phase 2: Make It Work (8 minutes)
**Goal**: Debug and fix issues (show AI problem-solving)

### Prompt 2: Fix Controls (if needed)
```
The WASD keys are not moving the snake properly. Please debug and fix:
- Make sure key events are captured correctly
- Ensure immediate response to WASD input
- Fix any timing or focus issues
- The controls should be smooth and responsive

I want perfect WASD controls that work immediately when I press the keys.
```

### Prompt 3: Test and Validate
```
Create a quick test to verify everything works:
- WASD movement is responsive
- Collision detection works correctly
- Food spawning and eating functions
- Score updates properly
- No crashes or bugs

Make sure the game is ready for demonstration.
```

### Phase 3: Make It Amazing (10 minutes)
**Goal**: Visual impact - wow the audience

### Prompt 4: Multiple Food Enhancement
```
Enhance the game to make it visually impressive:
- Add 2-3 colorful food items on the board simultaneously
- Use different colors: red, orange, yellow, pink, purple
- Make food items look 3D with shadows and highlights
- Add sparkle effects for visual appeal
- Smart positioning to avoid overlaps

Keep the same controls but make it look professional and eye-catching.
```

### Prompt 5: Visual Polish
```
Add final visual enhancements to wow the audience:
- Enhanced 3D food rendering with gradients
- Smooth shadows and highlight effects
- Professional game UI with food counter
- Make the snake look better with enhanced graphics
- Polish the overall appearance for demo

The goal is to make it look like a commercial game.
```

---

### Phase 4: Demo Finale (5 minutes)
**Goal**: Show final result + course promotion

### Prompt 6: Final Demo Prep
```
Prepare the game for live demonstration:
- Ensure it launches immediately without errors
- Create a simple launch command
- Verify all visual effects work smoothly
- Make sure controls are perfectly responsive
- Clean up any debug output

Create a version that's ready to impress an audience in a live demo.
```
