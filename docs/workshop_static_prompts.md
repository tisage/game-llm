# 🎯 20-Minute LLM Workshop: Snake Game Demo
**Purpose**: Showcase LLM Agent capabilities for rapid game development  
**Target**: Student engagement & course promotion  
**Time**: 20-30 minutes (with backup plans)  
**Focus**: Small, visible progress at each step  

---

## 🚀 Phase 1: "AI Understands" (5 minutes)
**Goal**: Show AI comprehension and planning

### Prompt 1: Concept & Quick Implementation
```
I want to create a simple Snake game using Python and Pygame for a 20-minute demo. 

Requirements:
- Single file implementation (snake_game.py)
- WASD controls
- 600x400 window with 20x15 grid
- Basic snake movement, food consumption, score display
- Clean, simple code that works immediately

Please create a complete, working Snake game in one file that I can run right away.
```

**Expected outcome**: Complete working game file  
**Student impact**: "Wow, AI built a whole game from description!"  
**Time check**: If this takes >5 min, use backup plan

---

## 🔧 Phase 2: "AI Fixes Problems" (7-8 minutes)
**Goal**: Show AI debugging capabilities

### Prompt 2: Control Debugging (Use if WASD doesn't work)
```
The WASD controls are not working properly in the Snake game. The snake doesn't move when I press keys. 

Please debug and fix:
- Key event handling
- Make sure WASD keys control the snake movement
- Ensure the game window has proper focus
- Make controls responsive and immediate

Fix the control issues and make sure the snake moves smoothly with WASD.
```

### Prompt 3: Quick Validation (Always use)
```
Please verify the game works correctly:
- Test that WASD moves the snake in correct directions
- Ensure food appears and can be eaten
- Check that score updates properly
- Confirm collision detection works (walls and self-collision)
- Make sure the game is smooth and bug-free

Add any quick fixes needed to make it demo-ready.
```

**Expected outcome**: Fully functional game with working controls  
**Student impact**: "AI actually debugs and fixes problems!"

---

## 🎨 Phase 3: "AI Makes It Amazing" (10-12 minutes)
**Goal**: Visual wow factor

### Prompt 4: Visual Enhancement
```
Now let's make this Snake game visually impressive for a demo:

Add these enhancements:
- 2-3 colorful food items on screen at once (red, orange, yellow)
- Make food items look 3D with simple shadows/highlights
- Add a nice background color and clean borders
- Show multiple food count in the score display
- Make the snake look more appealing (different shades of green)

Keep the same gameplay but make it look professional and eye-catching.
```

### Prompt 5: Final Polish (Optional - time permitting)
```
Add final touches to wow the audience:
- Smooth color gradients for food items
- Clean, professional UI with better fonts
- Add a simple sparkle or glow effect to food
- Polish the overall appearance
- Ensure everything looks demo-ready

Make it look like a commercial game prototype.
```

**Expected outcome**: Visually appealing game with multiple colorful food  
**Student impact**: "That looks like a real game!"

---

## 🎉 Phase 4: "Live Demo" (3-5 minutes)
### Prompt 6: Demo Preparation
```
Prepare the game for live demonstration:
- Make sure it launches immediately without errors
- Add any final stability improvements
- Clean up any debug output
- Ensure smooth performance
- Create a version ready to impress students

I need this to run perfectly for a live demo.
```

**Expected outcome**: Stable, impressive demo-ready game  
**Student impact**: "I want to learn how to do this!"

---

## ⏱️ Backup Plan (If things go wrong)

### Option A: Pre-built Fallback (Use if Prompt 1 fails)
- Have a working snake_game.py ready
- Focus on enhancement prompts (4-5) for visual impact
- "Let's start with this basic version and make it amazing"

### Option B: Quick Fix Prompts (For common issues)
```
# If controls don't work:
The snake is not responding to WASD keys. Please fix the key event handling to make WASD control the snake movement immediately.

# If game crashes:
The game is crashing when [describe issue]. Please fix this error and make the game stable.

# If visuals don't appear:
The visual enhancements are not showing properly. Please fix the rendering to display colorful food items and effects.
```

### Option C: Demonstration Mode (Last resort)
- Show pre-built enhanced version
- Walk through the code
- Explain how AI generated each part
- Focus on course promotion

## 🎯 Success Metrics

### Must Achieve (Minimum viable demo):
- ✅ Working Snake game generated by AI
- ✅ Students see AI respond to natural language
- ✅ At least one enhancement successfully applied
- ✅ Game runs smoothly during final demo

### Ideal Outcomes:
- ✅ All prompts work as expected
- ✅ Multiple visual enhancements applied
- ✅ Students are visibly impressed
- ✅ Clear connection to course value demonstrated
- ✅ Students ask follow-up questions about learning

### Course Promotion Integration:
- After successful generation: "This is prompt engineering in action"
- During debugging: "AI assists with real development challenges"
- During enhancement: "Imagine what you could build in a full course"
- Final demo: "Ready to master AI-assisted development?"

---

## 🗣️ Key Talking Points

1. **"Look how AI understands natural language"** (after Prompt 1)
2. **"AI doesn't just generate code, it solves problems"** (during debugging)
3. **"From concept to working prototype in minutes"** (during enhancement)
4. **"This is the future of software development"** (final demo)
5. **"Want to learn these industry-relevant skills?"** (course promotion)

## ⚠️ Risk Mitigation

### High Risk Scenarios:
- **Prompt 1 generates broken code**: Use backup file, focus on enhancement
- **Controls don't work**: Have fix prompt ready, use backup if needed
- **Visual effects fail**: Skip to demo, show the basic working version
- **Complete failure**: Switch to pre-built demo, explain the process

### Time Management:
- **Running behind**: Skip optional prompts, use backup for missing features
- **Ahead of schedule**: Add extra visual enhancements, take more questions
- **Technical issues**: Have backup plan ready, don't spend time debugging live

Remember: **The goal is student engagement, not perfect code!**
