# 🎯 Compact Master Prompt

## Single-Prompt Workshop Driver

```
I'm doing a 20-minute live demo workshop. Help me build a Snake game step-by-step by offering me choices at each stage.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Single file: snake_game.py
- Python + Pygame, 600x400 window
- WASD controls, collision detection
- Start with 1 food item, basic scoring

PROCESS:
1. Offer me 2-3 implementation approaches for basic Snake game
2. After I choose, implement it (window, movement, food, collision, score)
3. Test and confirm it works
4. Offer me 3 enhancement choices (visual/gameplay/UI improvements)
5. After I choose, implement and test
6. Offer final polish options if time permits

RULES:
- Always give exactly 2-3 clear choices with brief pros/cons
- Prioritize visual impact for live audience
- Test code after each implementation
- If something breaks, offer simpler alternatives immediately
- Keep existing features working

Start by offering me the basic implementation approaches.
