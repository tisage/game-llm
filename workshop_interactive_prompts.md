# 🎮 Interactive Workshop Prompts - Choice-Driven Development

## Phase 1: Requirements & Design Options (5-7 minutes)

### Prompt 1: Get Design Options
```
I want to build a Snake game using Python for a 20-minute workshop demo. Basic requirements:
- WASD controls
- Score tracking
- Food consumption and growth
- Collision detection
- Should work immediately when run

Please give me 2-3 different design approaches for this project. For each approach, explain:
1. File structure (single file vs multiple files)
2. Main classes/components
3. Pros and cons
4. Implementation complexity
5. Which is best for a quick demo

I want to choose the best approach with your guidance.
```

**Expected AI Response**: 2-3 different architectural approaches
**Demo Action**: Present options to students, let them vote/discuss, then choose

---

### Prompt 2: Confirm Choice & Get Implementation Plan
```
I like approach [X] because [reasons]. 

Now please give me 2-3 different ways to implement this approach:
1. How should we structure the main game loop?
2. What's the best way to handle input (WASD keys)?
3. How should we organize the rendering?

For each option, tell me the trade-offs and what's best for our 20-minute demo timeline.
```

**Expected AI Response**: Implementation strategy options
**Demo Action**: Quick discussion and choice

---

## Phase 2: Step-by-Step Implementation (10-12 minutes)

### Prompt 3: Start Implementation
```
Perfect! Let's go with [chosen approach]. 

Please implement the basic Snake game following this plan. Start with just the core functionality:
- Basic game window and loop
- Snake movement with WASD
- Simple collision detection
- One food item

Show me the code and let me test it before we add more features.
```

**Expected AI Response**: Basic working code
**Demo Action**: Test immediately, show students it works

---

### Prompt 4: Enhancement Options
```
Great! The basic game works. Now I want to enhance it. Please give me 3 different enhancement options we could add next:

1. What visual improvements could we make?
2. What gameplay features could we add?
3. What would make the biggest impact for a demo audience?

For each option, tell me:
- How long it would take to implement
- How impressive it would look
- Any risks or complications

Help me choose what to do next.
```

**Expected AI Response**: Enhancement options with analysis
**Demo Action**: Let students help choose which enhancement to pursue

---

## Phase 3: Chosen Enhancement (8-10 minutes)

### Prompt 5: Implement Chosen Enhancement
```
We've decided to go with [chosen enhancement]. Please implement this feature:

[Specific enhancement request based on choice]

Make sure to:
- Keep the existing functionality working
- Add the new feature cleanly
- Make it visually impressive for the demo
- Explain any trade-offs you're making

Show me the updated code when ready.
```

**Expected AI Response**: Enhanced version
**Demo Action**: Test and show off the improvement

---

### Prompt 6: Polish Options (if time permits)
```
Excellent! This looks great. We have a few more minutes. What are 2-3 quick polish improvements we could make to really impress the audience?

For each suggestion:
- How long would it take?
- What visual impact would it have?
- How risky is it (might it break something)?

I want to choose one final improvement to wow everyone.
```

**Expected AI Response**: Quick polish options
**Demo Action**: Choose and implement final touch

## Interactive Phrases for Students

### During option selection:
- "Let's see what design options the AI suggests..."
- "What do you think? Should we go with the simple approach or the more advanced one?"
- "The AI is giving us pros and cons - which factor is most important for our demo?"
- "Let's vote! Who thinks we should choose option 1? Option 2?"

### During implementation:
- "Notice how the AI understood our choice and is implementing exactly what we decided"
- "This is like having a senior developer on your team who can quickly implement your decisions"

### During enhancement selection:
- "Now we get to see AI's creativity - what improvements will it suggest?"
- "Which enhancement would you be most excited to see?"
- "The AI is analyzing trade-offs just like a real developer would"

---

## Emergency Backup for Each Phase

### If AI gives unclear options:
```
Please be more specific. Give me exactly 2 clear options:
Option A: [Simple approach]
Option B: [Advanced approach]

For each option, tell me exactly:
- What files we'll create
- How long it will take
- What the main benefits are

Make it easy for me to choose.
```

### If implementation fails:
```
This approach isn't working well. Let's try a simpler method:
- Single file approach
- Basic pygame structure
- Minimal classes, maximum functionality
- Focus on getting something working first

Please restart with the simplest possible approach.
```

### If students seem confused:
```
The current approach seems too complex for our audience. Please suggest:
1. A much simpler alternative
2. How to explain this more clearly
3. What we should focus on to keep it engaging

Help me adjust for the audience.
```

## Course Promotion Integration

### After design phase:
"This decision-making process with AI - this is exactly what you'll learn to do systematically in my course"

### After successful implementation:
"Notice how we collaborated with AI rather than just asking it to do everything - that's advanced prompt engineering"

### After enhancement choice:
"Imagine making these kinds of technical decisions with AI assistance on your own projects"

### Final demo:
"From requirements to working game through collaborative decision-making - this is the future of development"
