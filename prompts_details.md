# 🎯 Step-by-Step AI Prompts for Live Snake Game Development

**Workshop Format**: Interactive AI-assisted coding with GitHub Copilot CLI  
**Goal**: Build a working Snake game from scratch using AI prompts  
**Duration**: 20-30 minutes of live coding  
**Technology**: Pygame for real-time controls and simple graphics  
**Files to create**: `snake_game.py` (complete playable game)

## Prompts

```bash
I want to build a Snake game using Python, Pygame and Gradio. It should have keyboard controls, real-time movement, and simple graphics. What should be the main components and architecture?"

For the Pygame Snake game, I need: use AWSD key controls, 20x15 grid, real-time movement, collision detection, food consumption, and score display on Gradio. How to begin with?

Don't show me code for now. I need to discuss the design, framework, and architecture first.

```

## Design and start implementation

```bash
I'm using `.venv` for virtual environment. so you may need to provide all necessary setup for the packages requires. like `requirements.txt` file.

next, your logic looks good. so can you start the code implmentation for the backend code in `src` folder and frontend code in `frotend` folder? you will also test your code after every major implementation.

```

## Test and Debugging

```bash
why when I enter my awsd keys the snake is not moving? can you help me debug this issue?

```

## Imprevements

```bash
